Shop in Style: Your Feature-Rich Shopping Cart

This readme details a user-friendly shopping cart website built with HTML, CSS, and React JS.
It boasts a well-organized product display categorized for seamless browsing and a functional basket system for effortless purchases.

Functionality Highlights:

    Dual Category Display: Products are meticulously categorized for efficient browsing. Customers can easily navigate to their desired items without hassle.
    Add to Basket: With a simple click, users can seamlessly add products to their shopping cart, accumulating their selections for checkout.
    Price Display: Each product proudly displays its price, allowing customers to make informed decisions about their purchases and track their total spending.
    (Optional) Dynamic Updates: (If implemented) The shopping cart dynamically updates as users add or remove items, reflecting the current total price and quantity in real-time.

Technology Stack:*

    Frontend:
        HTML: Provides the foundation for content structure and organization.
        CSS: Enhances the visual appeal with styles, layouts, and formatting.
        JavaScript: Powers interactive elements, product adding functionality, and (optionally) dynamic basket updates.

Implementation Notes:

    The specific implementation details will depend on your chosen approach. Considerations include data storage (local storage, server-side database), interaction with the shopping cart (JavaScript events, form submissions), and user interface elements (buttons, cart display).
    Additional features can be incorporated upon further development, such as product quantity adjustment in the cart, product removal, and potentially discount calculations or coupon codes.

    Clone this repository to your local machine.
    Install any necessary dependencies (e.g., JavaScript libraries) based on your implementation approach.
    Configure the code to connect to your chosen data source (if applicable).
    Run a local development server (e.g., npm start) to test the functionalities.
    Once satisfied, deploy the website according to your chosen platform's instructions.
